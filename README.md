# Console-Finances

## Description

The primary goal of this project was to grasp fundamental JavaScript features, like mathematical operations, however it was kept tidy and neat by using loops and statements to prevent code repetition.
Using fundamental mathematical operations on an array of values and dates, this project was designed to answer common financial queries.
It does help to streamline the project using a single loop and an IF/ELSE sequence to reduce the requirement for human labour or even many lines of code.
I did discover how important "For" loops can be during the process, as well as how to set up the variables inside of one so that the information is contained properly.
